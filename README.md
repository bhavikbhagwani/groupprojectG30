Welcome to the Pig Dice Game! You are the player and you play against the computer.
You both have the objective to roll the dice and accumulate points to 
reach 50 points and win the game. Have fun and good luck.

# RULES

Player and computer take turns rolling a die.
If either rolls a 1, they lose their current round's points, and it's the next opponent's turn.
Either can choose to hold, adding their current round's points to their total score.
The first player to reach a score 50 points wins the game.
You can also cheat in the game, but your results or stats won't be stored if you cheat
